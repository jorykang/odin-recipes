    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Take the familiar flavours of carrot cake and applied them to my one-cup pancake method.</p>
    <p>Perfect for a Pancake Day breakfast with the kids!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
        <ul>
        <li>250g self-raising flour</li>
        <li>420ml semi-skimmed milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon, plus extra for dusting</li>
        <li>140g sultanas</li>
        <li>60g walnuts</li>
        <li>1 carrot</li>
        <li>1 tsp olive oil</li>
        <li>4 tbsp natural yogurt</li>
        <li>clear honey, to serve</li>
    </ul>

    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Fill the cup with the flour and tip into a large bowl.</p> <p>Fill the same cup with milk and pour that into the bowl, then crack in the egg and add 1 tsp cinnamon.</p><p>Whisk everything together until nice and smooth.</p></li>
        <li><p>Roughly chop the sultanas and bash the walnuts in a clean tea towel with a rolling pin and add both to the bowl.</p><p>Coarsely grate in the carrot and mix well.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat.</p> <p>Once hot, add a small drizzle of olive oil.</p> <p>Once the oil starts to sizzle, add 4 large spoonfuls of batter to the pan – you’ll need to do this in batches.</p> <p>Wait for little bubbles to form on the surface of the pancakes (about 1-2 mins), then use a fish slice to flip them over to cook for another 1-2 mins, or until golden again, on the other side.</p> <p>Transfer to a plate and keep warm in a low oven.</p> <p>Carefully wipe out the pan with a scrunched-up ball of kitchen paper, then add another drizzle of oil and cook the next batch.</p></li>
        <li>Serve the pancakes with a dollop of yogurt, an extra dusting of cinnamon and a drizzle of honey.</li>
        
    </ol>
